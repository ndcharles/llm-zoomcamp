    "## From RAG to Agents: Building Smart AI Assistants\n",
    "An attempt to recover my lost notes after Codespaces crashed on me ðŸ˜«\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines retrieval of information with generation by a Large Language Model (LLM). It is particularly effective when you have a specific knowledge base and want the LLM to answer questions only using that context.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG consists of 3 parts:\n",
    "- Search â†’ Finds relevant docs (e.g., FAQ entries about course enrollment).\n",
    "- Prompt â†’ Combines docs + query into a structured template.\n",
    "- LLM â†’ Generates a grounded answer (e.g., \"Yes, you can join late (see FAQ).\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Agents\n",
    "These are autonomous systems that interact with environments, make decisions, and perform actions (e.g., search, answer, modify data). \n",
    "Agents are AI systems that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make decisions about what actions to take\n",
    "- Use tools to accomplish tasks\n",
    "- Maintain state and context\n",
    "- Learn from previous interactions\n",
    "- Work towards specific goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic flow is not necessarily a completely independent agent, but it can still make some decisions during the flow execution\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical agentic flow consists of:\n",
    "- Receiving a user request\n",
    "- Analyzing the request and available tools\n",
    "- Deciding on the next action\n",
    "- Executing the action using appropriate tools\n",
    "- Evaluating the results\n",
    "- Either completing the task or continuing with more actions\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference from basic RAG is that agents can:\n",
    "- Make multiple search queries\n",
    "- Combine information from different sources\n",
    "- Decide when to stop searching\n",
    "- Use their own knowledge when appropriate\n",
    "- Chain multiple actions together\n",
    "\n",
    "So in agentic RAG, the system\n",
    "- has access to the history of previous actions\n",
    "- makes decisions independently based on the current information and the previous actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agentic RAG (Decision-Making)\n",
    "Agentic RAG enhances basic RAG by allowing the AI assistant to decide whether to answer a question directly using its own knowledge or to perform a search in the FAQ database. This is achieved by modifying the prompt to include instructions and output templates for different actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SEARCH: If the context is empty and the LLM decides it needs more information from the FAQ database\n",
    "- ANSWER (source: CONTEXT): If the LLM can answer the question using the provided context from a search\n",
    "- ANSWER (source: OWN_KNOWLEDGE): If the context does not contain the answer, or if the question can be answered without needing a search, the LLM uses its internal knowledge\n",

    "|--------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",

    "| **Memory**         | No history of past actions         | Tracks previous searches/queries to avoid redundancy |\n",
    "| **Tool Use**       | Single retrieval tool              | Chains multiple tools (search + edit + APIs) |\n",

    "### Agentic search\n",
    "Agentic search extends RAG with multi-query exploration and iterative refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Reformulates queries (e.g., \"How to excel in Module 1?\" â†’ \"Docker best practices\").\n",
    "- Combines results from multiple searches.\n",
    "- Stops when sufficient context is gathered or max iterations reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Deeper topic coverage than single-query RAG.\n",
